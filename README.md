## React & Vue

### Description

FasDeli has been growing more and more popular in the world of Logistics. Now, aiming for higher ambition, FasDeli wants to expand its market to the widely known, well prospects ground that offers chances to reach more customers, E-Commerce.

After much consulting, React and Vue were chosen as the best suitable web technology to build web applications with a highly automated system. We decided to give it a try. A chance to bring both FasDeliv and customers ability to present quick content advertising.

You, as the chosen one, need to create a flexible web application. Starting from Frontend with some **requirements:**

- The ecosystem has 2 sites (or pages): Admin to manage and Consumer to present
- API and data of your choices to show demonstrations (not important but should be one of Java, Nuxtjs, Nextjs, Expressjs)
- **(Admin)**

- Builder to Drag and Drop components (like WordPress). For now, we just need to have Paragraph and Button.

- Admin can change paragraph's text and button's alert message (read more in Consumer's requirement)

- Ability to undo and redo.

- Export and import the page to save and load later.

- **(Consumer)**

- Display the pages that are built by the Admin site (View Mode). When the user clicks the button, show an alert with the message set by Admin.

## Assessment

- As the sole architect, developer, designer of this system, you should make a simple document of how to setup and run i.e. README file
- Some screenshots of your result
- It should show your pride as one of your creations. What did you apply to make it the best? (Architecture, Principle, Design Pattern, Test, etc.)
- **You can (and should) plan out an estimation and send to us if possible.**

## Optional

As the creator of this product, you can try and offer FasDeli your ideas. You can add any feature that is suitable for the system. Some suggestions are Image Upload, Text Editor, etc.
